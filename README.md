This is "Guess The Number" Game, But User Version:
It means we have a game that pc randomly choose a number between (1, 100), (You can change it in python file),
The you should guess that number.

for example pc choose 84
then you should guess it

for example you enter: 35

then pc say to you: "Your Number is Smaller Than PC Number"

Then you should guess larger number,
for example: 70
and pc say it again

for next time you enter: 90

Then pc say to you: "Your Number is Larger Than PC Number"

then you choose: 85

it's larger again

then choose: 83

it's smaller this time

Then you choose: 84

And Nowwww!!! You winnn!

What is different between "user-version" & "pc-version":

user-version:
PC choose a randomly number and you(user), should guess it.

pc-version:
You(User) should Choose a number then PC guess it & you should help PC to find it.
